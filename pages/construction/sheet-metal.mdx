- ["Sheet metal" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_metal)

Sheet metal can be cut as a 2D sheet with a laser or plasma cutter, then folded into a 3D object.

In some areas, sheet metal cutting and folding can be more affordable and available than other manufacturing techniques like CNC machining.
